1. PCA- reduce the number of spectral bands by sklearn.decomposition.PCA.
    executes dimensionality reduction using SVD.
2. IMAGE_CUBES- smooth out outliers by grouping points next to each other, giving the label of the center point 
    (could try something else).
3. CLEANING- remove zero labels- reduces the number of data points by almost 5.
